1. PROS\n\n- Heavy openning damage;\n- Low necessity to change the position;\n- Strong against spread out enemies;\n- Medium cost champions ( average cost ~ 2,5);\n\n## 2. CONS\n\n- The team is highly dependent of Akali; \n- Hard to obtain complete efficiency ( the player need to be at level 8 or 7 plus having [[item=force-of-nature]]);\n- Low defensive power champions;\n- Low damage and survival against grouped champions or that are equipped with [[item=phantom-dancer]].\n\n## 3. WEAKNESS\n\nBy being glass cannon and dependent of critical damage, the ninja/assassins can’t survive for longer fights. Thus, this team's weaknesses are:\n\n### 3.1 Class / origin / abilities:\n\n- **Knights**;\n- **Glacials**;\n- **Yordles**.\n\n### 3.2 Items:\n\t\n- [[item=phantom-dancer]]\n\n- [[item=frozen-heart]]\n\n### 3.3 Positioning:\n\nThis build is weak against grouped teams, specially in the cases where the defensive champions are protecting the less defensive ones.\n\n## 4. TEAM CONCEPT\n\t\nThis team objective is to obtain these bonuses:\n\n- Class: 6 Assassins;\n- Origin: 4 Ninjas\n\nThe team is composed by 6 assassins (Khazix, Zed, Pyke, Rengar, Evelynn and Akali), that becomes invisible at the start of the battle then jump on the farthest enemy, in addition to two ninjas (Kennen and Shen), that are visible at the start of the battle. The crowd control of this team are in area and comes from the abilities of the champions Pyke, Evellyn and Kennen.\n\nAll champions of this team are glass cannons, in other words, they have high offensive power and low defensive power. The bonus of 6 assassins plus 4 ninjas, combined, provide a damage explosion to Akali and Zed. The fundamental piece (also the main dps) of the team is Akali. Akali, like Zed, is benefited by both bonuses: assassin and ninjas. Another interesting DPS is Pyke. Although he doesn’t benefit from the Ninja bonus, he has high survival and crowd control because of his skill. So, the main offensive items must be equipped on them ( Akali, Zed and eventually Pyke).\n\nShen and Kennen must be the defensive champions of the team and this will be possible by equipping survival items on these champions. This necessity is justified by the other champions becoming invisible at the start of the fight, causing enemies’ attention to be directed at them.\n\nThe defensive abilities of the team are from Pyke and Kennen, that stun the enemies in a certain area (Kennen at a circular area and Pyke in a straight line), and Shen that prevents, by a limited time, that the allied champions are hit within the area around him.\n\nLastly, this team needs to finish the combat at the initial moments of the match, otherwise the champions will not be able to stand a prolonged fight due to their low defensive power.\n\n## 5. GAME\n\nKhazix, Shen, Zed and Pyke will be available to buy starting from the second round of the game. Buy them whenever you have the opportunity. Starting from the third round (level 3), Rengar, Evelynn and Kennen will also be available. We suggest you to buy the following champions at the start of the game:\n\n- Khazix, Kassadin and RekSai; or\n- Khazix, Pyke and Zed.\n\nIn the first composition, it is possible to have the Origin bonus of 3 void but don’t make a 2 (star) Kassadin or RekSai, because they will be sold. As Pyke, Zed and Shen become available for purchase, buy them replacing Kassadin and RekSai to obtain the 3 assassin bonus. Shen will be the defensive figure at this point of the game.\n\nIn this composition, it’s important to evaluate the best time to insert the ninjas considering that the bonus is only for 1 or 4 ninjas, which means that in order to receive the bonus, it is necessary to have Akali in the team.\n\nIt is not recommended to have only assassins on the board because if the champions of the other team are grouped together, the assassins won’t manage to attack all at the same time and may end up jumping on the tanks. So make sure that at least Shen is on the board and preferably opposite to the enemies to ungroup them at the start of the fight.\n\nAs an Akali dependent team, it is recommended to reach level 5 and, when possible, make resource economy. Rengar, Evelynn and Kennen will be available starting from level 3, however, with a very low chance to appear. The chance will be higher at level 5. Whenever a champion of this composition appears, buy it. Try not to reroll, specially if your performance in the game is moderate or better.\n\nAs the match develops, the player must evaluate the combination of the bonus needed until level 8 (or level 7 + [[item=force-of-nature]]).\n\n- **Start of the game:** 3 assassins + 1 ninja / 4 ninjas (in case Akali has appeared);\n- **Mid game:** 6 assassins + 1 ninja / 4 ninjas + 3 assassins;\n- **Endgame:** 4 ninjas + 6 assassins.\n\nConsidering Akali, try to upgrade her to 2 stars to have a burst in the team’s damage. Try to get her (or her items) at the roulette whenever you can.\n\nIn the endgame, it is recommended to have the 4 ninjas and 3 assassins bonus first, since Akali e Zed, the top dps of the group, will have an extra bonus damage. Then, try to make the 6 assassins bonus.\n\nNote that  [[item=spatula]] is a very important item in this composition. During the game check your economy: if it’s poor, you will not be able to buy enough xp to get to level 8 quickly and you will need [[item=force-of-nature]] or  [[item=youmuus-ghostblade]] on a ninja.\n\nWhen the 2 bonuses are active, the damage will climb considerably, mostly by equipping the right items on Akali.\n\n## 6. POSITIONING\n\nThe champions of this team must be positioned, preferably, at the opposite side of the enemy champions. This way the enemy champions will be attracted to Shen and Kennen, while the assassins jump at the champion enemies. This strategy is fundamental to ungroup the enemy champions and allow some space for the assassins to attack. Kennen must be, preferably, behind Shen.\n\nBesides that, position the strongest four champions adjacent to Kennen (two at the left and two at the right) in order to receive the buff from [[item=locket-of-the-iron-solari]] and / or [[item=zekes-herald]].\n\n## 7. OFFENSIVE REMINDERS\n\n- Akali and Zed are the main DPS of the team and the offensive items must be reserved for them;\n- If have remaining items, equip two [[item=spear-of-shojin]] on Pyke.\n\n## 8. DEFENSIVE REMINDERS\n\nCrowd control comes from the following abilities:\n\n- **Kennen**: stun in a circular area around him;\n- **Pyke**: stun in a straight line at all enemy champions that his image pass through;\n- **Shen**: allies on the ability range area dodge all attacks;\n- **Evelynn**: hold up to 3 enemies on the floor.\n\nThe main defensive items must be equipped on Shen.\n\n## 9.

TEAM CONCEPT\n\nThe primary goal of this build is to get the origin bonus of 6 Yordles. The bonus provides a great chance to Yordles to dodge attacks, increasing the survivability. \n\nThe team is made up of six ranged champions and two melee. There are 4 crowd control abilities (Lulu, Poppy, Kennen e Gnar). \n\nExcept for Gnar and Poppy, the other champions are DPS and Veigar is the main DPS. Offensive items should be intended to him. After obtaining the 6th Yordles bonus, focus on getting the 4 sorcerers bonus to increase even more Veigar’s damage.\n\nPoppy and Gnar are the tanks of the team and the defensive items should be directed to them (mainly on Gnar). There are three area crowd control (Lulu, Kennen e Gnar) and one single target (Poppy). The combination of these four controls can disable the enemies for a long time, especially with the combination of Kennen’s and Gnar’s abilities. Lulu’ ability heals an ally and stuns the champions around that ally. You can direct some items to Lulu to increase the team survivability.\n\nYordle’s bonus gives an extra survivability to the glass cannons of the team. So, this build has several area crowd control and damage. The performance is even greater against grouped champions.\n\n## 5. GAME\nOnly Tristana will be available to purchase on the second turn. Buy her whenever you can. From turn 3 (level 3), Lulu will be available to purchase. Both champions are ranged and squishy and need a defensive champion to protect them. It is suggested to get Graves and / or Lucian in the early game for this protection. Graves can be on the front line while making the Gunslinger bonus with Tristana. Don’t buy Graves/Lucian above 2★, considering that they’ll be sold. Also, it’s not recommended to reroll the champions to try get Tristana 3★, since she isn’t the main DPS of the team. Save the resources to try get Veigar.\n\nPoppy, Veigar, and Kennen will be available for purchase at level 3, but with a small chance (5%). The chances are higher starting from level 5 (25%). You need to balance between saving resources and getting to level 5 or above quickly. The player must choose the way to go and will depend on the game’s performance. Buy Veigar whenever you can, since he is the main DPS and make him 3★ its extremely important due his ability.\n\nAt midgame, the tanks (Poppy and Gnar) will be available. As soon as you get them, put them in Grave’s / Lucian’s place. Gnar is fundamental to the composition and he will only be available to purchase from level 5. Buy or get Gnar on rolls until you can turn him 2★. It's not interesting to invest more resources on Gnar beyond this point since it will be hard to get him to 3★ and the resources must be used to get Veigar to 3★. \n\nAt the endgame, with the 6 Yordles’s bonus, try to get Veigar 3★ (if you haven't succeeded yet) and try to level up to put Aurelian Sol and Karthus in game.\n\n## 6. POSITIONING\n\nThe positioning of this build must consider the Yordles’s bonus and Gnar’s and Kennen’s crowd control:\n\n- Tristana must be away on the grid (bottom left corner). If assassins jumps on her or Blitzcrank pulls her, the Yordles’s bonus will give an extra survivability. If Tristana dies, it won’t be a great loss, since she isn’t the main DPS;\n\n- Kennen must be positioned in middle to combinate his ability with Gnar’s ability. If Kennen has [[item=locket-of-the-iron-solari]] and / or [[item=zekes-herald]], he will provide buffs to adjacente allies (Lulu e Veigar);\n\n- Gnar and Poppy must be in front to tank the damage. When Gnar transform, he’ll jump on the farthest enemy and push him nearby enemies to Kennen’s ability;\n\n- Veigar is the main DPS and must be on the safest location.\nAs for group positioning , you need to watch the enemies’s positioning. Your positioning must be as close to the enemy champions as possible for better efficiency in area’s damage and crowd control. \n\n## 7. OFFENSIVE REMINDER\n\n- Veigar is the main DPS and the offensive items must be directed to him.\n\n## 8. DEFENSIVE REMINDER\n\n- Kennen’s ability do area’s crowd control and do combo with Gnar’s ability;\n- Gnar jumps on farthest enemy and push him and next enemies. Defensive items must be directed to him;\n- Poppy ability knocking up the enemy;\n- Aurelian Sol and Karthus do not do not benefit from Yordle’s bonus.\n\n## 9. ALTERNATIVE CHAMPIONS\n\n \n- [[champion=ahri]]: Sorcerer with wild bonus (combo with Gnar);\n\n- [[champion=kayle]]: knight that provide shield and do knight bonus with Poppy (increasing team survivability).\n"},"2a8b8ec7":{"id":"2a8b8ec7","key":"glacial-rangers","name":"Glacial Rangers","tier":"S","author":"KenjiHimura","lang":"en-us","composition":[{"champion":"82","items":["45","66","25"],"isCarry":false},{"champion":"113","items":["77","44","66"],"isCarry":true},{"champion":"22","items":["24","24","24"],"isCarry":true},{"champion":"203","items":["67","17","35"],"isCarry":false},{"champion":"34","items":["44","44","37"],"isCarry":false},{"champion":"110","items":["24","24","24"],"isCarry":false},{"champion":"67","items":["24","24","24"],"isCarry":false},{"champion":"106","items":["22","22","57"],"isCarry":false}],"positioning":{"1,1":"82","1,2":"113","2,1":"22","2,2":"203","3,1":"34","2,3":"110","3,2":"67","3,3":"106"},"guide":"## 1.

WEAKNESS\n\nRangers and Glacials are weak against:\n\n### 3.1 Class / origin and abilities:\n\n- **Demon:** burns enemies' mana, preventing Sejuani to freeze in area;\n- **Assassins:** with the right positioning, assassins can kill rangers really fast, especially if tanks are pulled away from rangers.\n\n### 3.2 Items:\n\n- [[item=hush]]\n- [[item=frozen-heart]]\n\n\n### 3.3 Positioning\n\n- Spread out enemies will suffer less area damage and crowd control.\n\n## 4. TEAM CONCEPT\n\nThe primary goal of this build is to get the bonus of:\n\n- 4  Rangers;\n- 4 Glacials;\n- 2 Phantom.\n\nThe team is made up of 5 ranged and 3 melee champions. The crowd controls comes from Glacial attacks  (Ashe, Anivia, Volibear and Sejuani), besides from Sejuani’s ability that casts a storm that freezes the enemies inside the area. Ashe’s ability freezes the farthest enemy. Mordekaiser and Varus’ abilities give damage in straight line. \n\nAshe is the main DPS and the offensive items should be given to her. Varus is another champion that is interesting to give offensive items. Volibear’s ability allows his attacks to spread out to other targets and apply item effects on hit (so the recommendation of items like [[item=red-buff]]).\n\nMordekaiser and Sejuani are the defensive champions of the build. The defensive items should be intended to Sejuani. Kindred have a fundamental role on team’s defense due to his ability of preventing allies to die in the ability zone and the Phantom’s bonus that curses an enemy at the beginning of the turn, setting their HP to 100.\n\nSo, this composition has strong individual attacks from rangers and a strong crowd control.  The performance is even greater against grouped champions.\n\n\n\n## 5. GAME\n\nMordekaiser, Vayne and Varus will be available to purchase on the second turn of the game. Buy them whenever you can. At level 3, Ashe and Volibear  will also be available to be purchased. In the early game, it is suggested to get Garen and Fiora. Together with Vayne, they will provide nobles’ and knights’ bonus. Later, Garen and Fiora will be sold, so don’t spend resources to make them greater than 2★.\n\nKnights’ and nobles’ bonus provide strong survivability in the early game, allowing you to save resources. It’s not recommended to reroll the champions to try to get Mordekaiser and Vayne 3★. Instead, spend resources naturally to try to get them to level 2★ in the early game and eventually level 3★ during mid and endgame. Save resources to level up and increase your chances to get Kindred and Sejuani.\n\nAshe and Volibear will be available to purchase at level 3, but with a low chance (5%). The chances are higher from level 5 (25%) and above.  You need to balance between saving resources and getting to level 5 or above quickly. The player must choose the way to go and will depend on the game’s performance.\n\nIn mid game, Mordekaiser and Sejuani will be the tanks of the team. Kindred is fundamental, but will appear only from level 5 and with a low chance. If Kindred appear in the roulette, try to get him to 2★. After that, don’t spend resources to try to get him to 3★, since it will be hard and expensive. Same goes for Sejuani. Upon obtaining Kindred, the build will start to be more effective, since you’ll get rangers’ and phantom’s bonus. \n\nWhen you get to level  8 (or level 7 + [[item=force-of-nature]]), get Anivia in the game to obtain the Glacial bonus.\n\n## 6. POSITIONING\n\nThe main positioning notes of this build are:\n\n- Anivia must be away on the grid (bottom left corner). If assassins jumps on her or Blitzcrank pulls her and she dies, it won’t be a great loss, since she isn’t the main DPS;\n\n- Kindred must be in the middle of the allies to protect as many champions as possible. It will also provide buffs if it’s equipped with [[item=locket-of-the-iron-solari]] and / or [[item=zekes-herald]];\n- Mordekaiser and Sejuani must be in front to tank the damage. Sejuani must be the most advanced champion to activate her ability as quickly as possible;\n\n- Ashe and Varus are the main DPS of the team and must be adjacent to  Kindred for protection and buffs.\n\nAs for group positioning , you need to watch the enemies’ positioning. Your positioning must be as close to the enemy champions as possible for better efficiency in Sejuani’s ability.  \n\nIf the opposing team also has strong control in the area, the champions of line 2 (Kindred, Ashe, Varus and Volibear) can be replaced by the champions of line 3 (Anivia and Vayne).\n\n## 7. OFFENSIVE REMINDER\n\n- Ashe and Varus are the main DPS of the team and the offensive items must be intended for them;\n- Ashe’s ability freezes the farthest enemy;\n- Varus’ ability hits enemies in a straight line;\n- Volibear’s ability allows his attacks to spread out to other targets and apply item effects on hit;\n\n## 8. DEFENSIVE REMINDER\n\n- Kindred must be positioned around the maximum number of champions as possible due his ability;\n- Defensive items must be intended to Sejuani to increase her survivability and to cast the ability as much as possible;\n- Attacks from Glacial have a chance to freeze the enemies.\n- Frozen Mallet transforms the champion into Glacial, also giving the freezing effect on normal attacks. It is a good idea to equip it in Varus, Kindred or Vayne, as they have high attack speed.\n\n## 9. ALTERNATIVE CHAMPIONS\n\n \n- [[champion=braum]]\n- [[champion=kayle]]\n\nSince Sejuani and Anivia are high tier champions, you can use Braum before getting them.\nIn place of Anivia, Kayle can be chosen for extra survivability of the team. Equip her it with [[item=frozen-mallet]] to gain the 4th  glacial bonus.\n\n## 10. OBSERVATION\n\nIf you get one [[item=spatula]] and you don't get the second to make [[item=force-of-nature]], you can combine it with item [[item=giants-belt]] and make [[item=frozen-mallet]], which turn the user in Glacial. It's a great way to pair up with other non-ice ranger or Kayle.\n\nAnother item formed from [[item=spatula]] is [[item=runaans-hurricane]], whose attacks propagate to an extra target and applies the effects of the items when hitting enemies. This item is also good for spreading the freezing effects of glacial attacks.\n\n\n"}},"byKey":{"yordle-sorcerers":"0b6a75b7","glacial-rangers":"2a8b8ec7","ninjas-assassins":"21536083"}}}
